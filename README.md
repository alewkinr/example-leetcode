# example-leetcode

This repository contains different task solved at [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com).

## Structure

Each task at leetcode.com has its own number and name so as does each directory in this repository. You can easily find
any task by the number and name of the task.

In the task folder you may find different subdirectories for different programming languages. I mostly focus on golang,
so this is the main language, but sometimes I might be bored and try to solve different tasks in any other language.

Wish you luck in exploring my experience! üçÄ
